            Fitfull creature, dead of night<br>
            Of heaving soul and moaning light<br>
            who's cursed by god to walk anew<br>
            amongst the jungle, always through<br>
            the thickest trees amongst the fray<br>
            the winding vines, the wilding way<br>
            the danger lurking evermore<br>
            and who doth his reserve it for?<br>
            <br>
            The tiger! Oh! the beast of yore!<br>
            The twinkling devil! The Ghastly sore!<br>
            It's he who walks the plain alone<br>
            to stalk and prey and kill and moan<br>
            for when he sees the prey to kill<br>
            he curls his paws, his whiskers stills<br>
            He stares at what he longs for most<br>
            his lurid fun, his bitter toast<br>
            <br>
            and when he so decides to maim<br>
            the poorest babe, the smallest game,<br>
            he lets the blood drip ear from ear<br>
            across his face, down his vineer <br>
            of course That's what he ought to do<br>
            To kill for fun and tear in two<br>
            The sweetest child that god create <br>
            and drag untward, to heavan's gate<br>
            <br>
