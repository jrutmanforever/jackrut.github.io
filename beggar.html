            ><br><br>
            As I walk the empty street, the winding path, the timeless beat ,<br>
            There lies a beggar undernieth, who sits out by my door<br>
            He lies there fading, drunken, shaking, crying out at his unmaking<br>
            For the devil has such taken, his worthless soul,<br>
            foreveormore<br>
            <br>
            His god and country, have no power, for when it hits the boozing hour<br>
            they may as well just duck and cower<br>
            as his druken wish implore<br>
            <br>
            He finds sole recourse from the bottle, That poisons souls and corpses mottle<br>
            That dead men weep and love and coddle,<br>
            that thrusts them on the floor<br>
            <br>
            And still the bottle breaths anew<br>
            The childish spark, the morning dew<br>
            The breathing hum, electric light,<br>
            the swirling sky, the twinkling night<br>
            <br>
            Did god create unearthly skies?<br>
            Or satan draw its thin disguise?<br>
            I could have sworn I never knew<br>
            That life could be so fresh, so new<br>
            <br>
            And so I do not deign to judge, his wiley drink, unearthly sludge<br>
            For how could I wont to compare, my common trifles, pointless cares<br>
            <br>
            Oh when he lies there, pensive calm,<br>
            so weather beaten, wistful, gone<br>
            The worries of the world and more, <br>
            lay vacant, dead, upon the shore.<br>
